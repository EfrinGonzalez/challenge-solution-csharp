## How to run
As the program uses AppSettings, the only parameter will be auth. The idea would be to manage configurations internally. The auth token has to be introduce in the command-line in order to execute the program correctly.

Once you are inside the root, where the solution file is at "../challenge-solution-csharp" you will need to run the following: 

docker build -t challenge .
docker run --rm -it challenge --auth n7mmqne5zi1m

The solution contains a .git history where you can see the different commits during the process. The branches have been deleted once merged into the master branch.
